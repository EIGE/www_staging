Social protection systems must ensure that people who need medical or social care can get it regardless of their income or wealth and that the cost of such care does not cause poverty to the care recipients or their relatives.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAccess to healthcare implies that ability to pay is not a precondition to receiving care and that the need for care does not lead to impoverishment. Consistent increases in expenditure, coupled with increasing population coverage over the years, have allowed Member States to generally ensure all residents have access to basic healthcare as well as ensuring that the need for healthcare is not a major cause of poverty and financial dependence of patients and their relatives. Despite that, there remain important access inequities to address.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAccess barriers include lack of coverage of certain types of care, high individual financial costs of care, geographical disparities of supply, waiting times and lack of information. Limiting access can save costs but if too high can result in belated and more costly treatment. Moreover, countries identify different experiences of care use across socio-economic groups (e.g. richer households make more use of preventive and specialist care than poorer households who make more use of emergency hospital care).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eDuring the preparation of the Austrian Presidency report in 2006, data were not available.\u003c/p\u003e",
