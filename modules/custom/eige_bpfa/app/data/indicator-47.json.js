Employment is perceived by many Member States as a key factor of social inclusion and offers the most important means of escaping the poverty cycle. Being employed and earning wages is crucial for the economic independence of women and men; therefore, those events that may lead women and men of working age to interrupt their working lives or not to participate in the labour market can generate a potential risk of poverty. The responsibility for family care still falls mainly on women, in part due to social stereotypes regarding women’s and men’s roles in the family and society. Due to gender imbalances, the interruption of working life or inactivity for family care reasons can act as women-specific factors that may generate a loss of economic independence and, later in the life cycle, a lower level of social protection (lower pensions).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eFor analysis of the situation, the age group 16 years and over has been used in this report.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eInactivity has been defined as the percentage of persons, who are classified neither as employed nor as unemployed in the labour market. Employed persons are all persons who worked at least one hour for pay or profit during the reference week or were temporarily absent from such work. Unemployed persons are all persons who were not employed during the reference week and had actively sought work during the past four weeks and were ready to begin working immediately within two weeks. Inactivity does not, however, mean that persons who are in this category are inactive in general. They can, for example, be taking care of children or incapacitated adults, doing domestic work or studying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot looking for a job for family care or personal reasons is the share of persons who are outside the labour market and not looking for work due to family or personal reasons and caring for children or incapacitated adults.\u003c/p\u003e",

The reason corresponding to ‘looking after children or incapacitated adults’ was only introduced from 2006 in the EU-LFS survey, which causes important breaks in the time series. It is, therefore, recommended to limit the time series analysis to 2006 and after. The data are updated annually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason for inactivity captured by this variable deals with the main reason why somebody is not seeking employment. It has to be noted that in some cases, the main reason may not be the only reason for not looking for a job. In additions, the reasons for not looking for a job for family care and personal reasons are presented separately in the table.\u003c/p\u003e",
