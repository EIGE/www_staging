Among international human rights treaties, the CEDAW assumes an important position, bringing women into the focus of human rights concern. It defines what constitutes discrimination against women and sets up an agenda for national action to end such discrimination. In so doing, the Convention establishes not only an international bill of rights for women, but also an agenda for action by countries to guarantee the enjoyment of those rights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addressing the enjoyment of human rights, governments and other actors should promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies and programmes so that before decisions are taken, an analysis is made of the effects on women and men, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/sites/default/files/documents/Overview%20of%20BPfA%20-%20Human%20Rights%20of%20Women%20-%20I.pdf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverview of the area I.
