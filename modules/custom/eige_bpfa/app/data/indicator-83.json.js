The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator measures women’s representation in fields of political decision-making, assessing the proportion of women in the two highest ranking positions of national ministries and European Institutions by BEIS functions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eOn the national level have been covered ministries or government departments on level 1 administrators: highest level of administrative (non-political) positions within each ministry and level 2 administrators: second level of administrative (non-political) positions within each ministry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe BEIS typology includes four types of state functions:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eB: Basic functions — foreign and internal affairs, defence, justice, etc.;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eE: Economic functions — finance, trade, industry, agriculture, etc.;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI: Infrastructure — traffic, communication, environment, etc.;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eS: Sociocultural functions — social affairs, health, children, family, youth, elderly people, education, science, culture, labour, sports, etc.\u003c/p\u003e",
