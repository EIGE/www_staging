  "concept": "\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe indicator is divided into two parts. The indicator investigates the proportion of female and male graduates at ISCED 5a level from academic institutions analysed by field of study, which includes tertiary educational programmes with an academic orientation. The ISCED 5a graduates are qualified to enter a profession with high skills requirements or an advanced research programme.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe indicator also denotes the proportion of female and male graduates at PhD/doctorate or equivalent level (ISCED 6) of all graduates at PhD/doctorate or equivalent level from academic institutions analysed by field of study. Investigating broad fields of study at ISCED 5a level and PhD/doctorate or equivalent level sheds light on the gender balance among highly qualified graduates as they reach the point of both admission to the advanced research programmes and entry into employment. Similarly, it indicates female and male achievement rates across the different fields of study at the academic and advanced research level.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe following fields of study have been used for analysing the situation in the report:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eall fields of study\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eteacher training and education science;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehumanities and arts;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esocial sciences, business and law;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003escience, mathematics and computing;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eengineering, manufacturing and construction;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eagriculture and veterinary;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehealth and Welfare.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",

Furthermore, the degree structures differ between countries and the indicators on tertiary graduates by fields of study are, therefore, affected by differences in countries’ degree structures.\u003c/p\u003e",
