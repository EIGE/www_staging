Macroeconomic decision-making centres are institutions responsible for conceiving and formulating ideas, determining strategies and implementing fiscal, monetary and income (economic) policies on behalf of the state or institutions they represent. Macroeconomic decision-makers are those who occupy formal and institutional positions in decision-making bodies and are actively involved in the deliberation and determination of economic policies and are responsible for implementing them on behalf of the state or institutions they represent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eMacroeconomic decisions, along with political decisions, have broad societal implications and the equal representation of women in the relevant structures is a necessary prerequisite for the empowerment of women and for women’s interests to be taken fully into account. Furthermore, macroeconomic institutions influence overall economic development, monetary stability and employment growth. Female representation at this level can, therefore, be seen as crucial to democracy and key to the development of gender equality in the labour market and society as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator assesses the proportion of women among ministers and deputy ministers/vice-ministers of the economic ministries in the Member States. Both senior and junior ministers should be included: senior ministers are members of the government who have a seat in the cabinet or council of ministers and junior ministers are members of the government who do not have a seat in the cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe economic ministries should be defined according to BEIS typology: they are included under E: Economic functions — finance, trade, industry, agriculture, etc.\u003c/p\u003e",

  "notes": "\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe indicator covers all EU Member States and the oldest data are available from 2004. Data are collected and published quarterly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eData are collected directly from the national governments’ websites where they are regularly updated, which should ensure good reliability. There is rather good comparability between countries and over time. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that the functions corresponding to deputy/vice-ministers can vary from one country to another and within a country over time.\u003c/p\u003e",
