This indicator reflects the ‘total pay gap’ (i.e. the inequality in the division of earnings between men and women in one country). This indicator is reformulated in a more neutral fashion from the gender point of view: it is expressed as the share of the total number of wage-earners by sex.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAn additional calculation is included, to highlight the effect of part-time work for this indicator. It indicates the share of women and of men in the total volume of work, in other words in the number of actual working days or hours worked. This is justified by the need to take account of part-time work, since such work mainly involves women, and is a source of inequality between women and men in the labour market. In this way, the impact of the differences between women and men in terms of working time can be measured, and the total pay gap can be expressed either unadjusted or adjusted for working time. The second general indicator thus calculates the total pay gap on the basis of the share of women and of men in the total sum of wages and on the basis of their participation in the labour market in terms of the number of actual working days as an employee.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator includes following three sub indicators:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eF9a: Share of all wages by sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF9b: Repartition of the total number of wage-earners by sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF9c: Repartition of the total number of actual working days by sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
