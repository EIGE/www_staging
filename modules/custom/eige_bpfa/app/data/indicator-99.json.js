Girls often regard their own bodies merely as a sexually interesting and exciting object to be invested in personal relations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eBody self-image can play a crucial role for another aspect of the girl child’s health, namely in relation to eating disorders. The idea of body image in relation to weight, therefore, needs to be explained. Eating disorders are frequently connected to bulimia and anorexia, although the issue of overweight, which has mostly psychological and psychosocial roots as well, is becoming increasingly important. Overweight is often the consequence of unhealthy eating habits, which are also connected to socioeconomic status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second indicator on body self-image comprises data on dissatisfaction with their bodies among girls and boys aged 15. This indicator examines the different self-perception of girls and boys regarding their body image, which has implications for public health. Girls’ and young women’s dissatisfaction with their bodies does not always reflect a physical condition such as a weight problem, but may be the result of culturally imposed norms and images, which might lead to destructive behaviours such as eating disorders and dysfunctional self-perception of the body image and of sexual attractiveness; these norms and images are significantly influenced by the media. It is, therefore, important to tackle the reasons underlying the dissatisfaction of girls and boys with their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e",
