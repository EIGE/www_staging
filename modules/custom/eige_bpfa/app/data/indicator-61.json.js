ISCED 5 is defined as the first stage of tertiary education and comprises the two categories ISCED 5a and ISCED 5b. Most ISCED 5a programmes are largely theoretically based and intended to provide sufficient qualifications for gaining entry into advanced research programmes or professions with high skills requirements. ISCED 5b programmes are practically oriented and the programmes’ content is typically designed to prepare students to enter a specific occupation. The qualifications acquired in ISCED 5b programmes do not give direct access to advanced research programmes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe classification ISCED 6 refers to programmes in the second stage of tertiary education that lead to the award of an advanced research qualification, often at doctorate or PhD level or beyond. The programmes are devoted to advanced study, original research and prepare graduates for an academic career in institutions of higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe indicator distinguishes between female and male graduates with ISCED 5 and ISCED 6 qualifications, and thus illustrates the tendency of females engaging in mathematics, sciences and technical disciplines with regard to the level of qualifications acquired as well as vocational destinations. The distinction adds to the depth of the analysis, as the educational decisions and achievements of graduates can largely determine the career and societal roles available to them. Furthermore, the disciplines of interest have been qualified in more detail so as to reveal possible differences. The presentation of the data as a proportion of the total number of graduates in the respective fields facilitates the analysis and, therefore, the identification of both horizontal and vertical segregation\u003c/p\u003e",
