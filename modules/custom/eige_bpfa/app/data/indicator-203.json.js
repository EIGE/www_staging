Two factors that heavily influence wage formation, and hence the pay gap, are the individual’s age and level of education. A person’s age is relevant as an indicator of professional experience, career development and vertical segregation. It also indicates to what extent seniority and professional experience are reflected in pay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAs regards the employment rate of the youngest group, it should be borne in mind that many of the people in that category are still studying and so are not looking for a job. Age is a partial indicator of a person’s level of professional experience and participation in the labour market depends heavily on the level of education: the employment rate generally rises in line with the level of education. This is particularly true for women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator includes following four sub-indicators:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e F11a: Employment rate by age and sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF11b: Pay gap according to age group (\u0026lt; 24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64 and 65+) based on hourly wages of female and male workers, full-time and part-time workers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF11c: Employment rate by educational level (ISCED, 3 levels)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF11d: Pay gap by educational level (ISCED, 3 levels), full-time and part-time workers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
