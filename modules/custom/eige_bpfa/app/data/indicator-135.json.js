The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThere are several policies and/or measures that can be implemented in politics by law, government activity, party policies or other means to improve the situation of women in decision-making. These include gender quotas set by different actors, targets or goals set by different actors, all-women shortlists, positive action programmes, sanctions or rewards.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator describes policies and measures taken by governments to reach a gender balance in parliaments at national/federal, regional and local levels. One of the main reasons for developing objective measures to describe women’s participation in the governance of their countries is to support governments and other actors in seeking and finding active measures to increase the share of women in public power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne way of improving the gender balance amongst candidates is to apply special measures in the form of general goals/targets, minimum recommendations or gender quotas that regulate the composition of the list of candidates put forward for elections.\u003c/p\u003e",

In comparing countries, it should be borne in mind that political systems differ from one country to another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe indicator could be split in several sub-indicators by measures/tools (e.g. quotas) and/or by level (national, regional, local). Information on gender balance in political parties could also be included. Moreover, it would be interesting to create a database presenting all the policies in favour of a better participation of women in political elections.\u003c/p\u003e",
