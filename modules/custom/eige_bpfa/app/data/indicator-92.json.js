Macroeconomic decision-making centres are institutions responsible for conceiving and formulating ideas, determining strategies and implementing fiscal, monetary and income (economic) policies on behalf of the state or the institutions they represent. Macroeconomic decision-makers are those who occupy formal and institutional positions in decision-making bodies and are actively involved in the deliberation and determination of economic policies and are responsible for implementing them on behalf of the state or institutions they represent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eMacroeconomic decisions, along with political decisions, have broad societal implications and the equal representation of women in the relevant structures is a necessary prerequisite for the empowerment of women and for women’s interests to be taken fully into account. Furthermore, macroeconomic institutions influence overall economic development, monetary stability and employment growth. Female representation at this level can, therefore, be seen as crucial to democracy and key to the development of gender equality in the labour market and society as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe indicator assesses the proportion of women among the presidents of the highest decision-making bodies of the top 50 firms publicly quoted on the national stock exchange. The companies covered in the calculation of this indicator are the largest publicly listed companies in each country: \u0026nbsp;‘publicly listed’ means that the shares of the company are traded on the stock exchange. The ‘largest’ companies are taken to be the members (maximum 50) of the primary blue-chip index, which is an index maintained by the stock exchange covering the largest companies by market capitalisation and/or market trades. Only companies which are registered in the country concerned are counted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA chairman of the board of directors (supervisory board in the case of separated supervisory and executive functions) should be identified as a chief of executive boards.\u003c/p\u003e",

Data are collected and published annually.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eData are collected from company websites, stock exchange websites, and company annual reports. Sometimes information on the composition of the highest decision-making body is not readily available and has to be retrieved from annual reports which may not be so up to date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComparability between countries is good, but it is necessary to bear in mind that the list of companies covered is different from one country to another. In making comparisons over time, it should be taken into account that changes in the methodology applied in 2007 affected the coverage of companies but this should not have a major impact on the overall results for each country except in the case that the sample size was small. From 2008, the rule of a minimum of 10 companies per country was applied so that discrepancies due to sample size are reduced.\u003c/p\u003e",
