The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator measures women’s representation in different fields of political decision-making: the proportion of women of the members of the national/federal governments and the proportion of female members of the European Commission in the different fields of action according to BEIS typology. The BEIS typology includes four types of state functions:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eB: Basic functions — foreign and internal affairs, defence, justice, etc.;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eE: Economic functions — finance, trade, industry, agriculture, etc.;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI: Infrastructure — traffic, communication, environment, etc.;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eS: Sociocultural functions — social affairs, health, children, family, youth, elderly people, education, science, culture, labour, sports, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll ministers in national governments should be included: senior ministers are the members of the government who have a seat in the cabinet or council of ministers and junior ministers are the members of the government who do not have a seat in the cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e",
