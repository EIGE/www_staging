ISCED 5 is defined as the first stage of tertiary education and comprises the two categories ISCED 5a and ISCED 5b. Most ISCED 5a programmes are largely theoretically based and intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programmes or professions with high skills requirements. ISCED 5b programmes are practically oriented and the programme content is typically designed to prepare students for entering a specific occupation. The qualifications acquired in ISCED 5b programmes do not give direct access to advanced research programmes. ISCED 6 refers to programmes in the second stage of tertiary education that entitles the award of an advanced research qualification, often at Doctorate or PhD level or beyond. The programmes are devoted to advanced study, original research and prepare graduates for an academic career in institutions of higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe strategic objective K.1 of the BPfA is to ‘involve women actively in environmental decision-making at all levels’. One of the actions to be taken by governments under the first strategic objective is to facilitate and increase women’s access to information and education, including in the areas of science, technology and economics, thus enhancing their knowledge, skills and opportunities for participation in environmental decisions’, and so Indicator 4 measures the proportion of women graduates in natural sciences and technologies. It must be emphasised, however, that not all areas included in the calculation of the indicator are directly linked with climate change, nor have all areas directly linked with climate change been taken into account.\u003c/p\u003e",

From 2014, Eurostat will switch to the ISCED 2011 system, which will allow for a more detailed breakdown of tertiary-level programmes. If the sex-disaggregated data are sufficiently comprehensive to allow for meaningful comparisons of the proportion of female graduates in the relevant fields in the more detailed levels of tertiary programmes across the EU Member States, the indicator could consider more detailed monitoring on such a scale. Adding post-secondary programmes (ISCED 3) that qualify for entrance to tertiary programmes in the relevant field could also be considered if the data become sufficiently comprehensive at Member State level to enable a reliable picture of the situation across the EU.\u003c/p\u003e",
