Armed and other types of conflicts and terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eWomen are affected by armed conflict in a variety of ways: they are victims of gender-based violence, peace and reconstruction actors, and combatants or members of the armed forces, volunteers or not. Women and children constitute some 80\u0026nbsp;% of the world’s millions of refugees and other displaced persons, including internally displaced persons. In addition, women often become caregivers for injured combatants and find themselves, as a result of conflict, unexpectedly cast as sole manager of household, sole parent, and caretaker of elderly relatives.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eParticipation of women in the promotion of peace through conflict prevention, management and resolution is essential not only to the maintenance and promotion of peace and security but also to ensure equal rights. The equal access and full participation of women in power structures and their full involvement in all efforts for the prevention and resolution of conflicts are essential for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Although women have begun to play an important role in conflict resolution, peacekeeping and defence and foreign affairs mechanisms, they are still underrepresented in decision-making positions. If women are to play an equal part in securing and maintaining peace, they must be empowered politically and economically and represented adequately at all levels of decision-making. Refugee, displaced and migrant women in most cases display strength, endurance and resourcefulness and can contribute positively to countries of resettlement or to their country of origin on their return. They need to be appropriately involved in decisions that affect them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eIn addressing armed or other conflicts, an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes should be promoted so that before decisions are taken an analysis is made of the effects on women and men, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/sites/default/files/documents/Overview%20of%20BPfA%20-%20Women%20and%20Armed%20Conflict%20-%20E.pdf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverview of the area E.

At the same time, it was pointed out that the proposed limited set of indicators cannot cover such a vast, complex area and would appear to be inadequate in the context of the different time periods (before, during, after) and sectoral policies that have an impact on conflict prevention, peacekeeping operations, peace negotiations, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, security system reform, post-conflict development policy, etc. Each of these sectors requires a series of indicators, which should, as far as possible, be put into context through regional approaches.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn December 2008, during the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/lsa/104835.pdf\"\u003emeeting\u003c/a\u003e the Council of the European Union adopted draft \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/lsa/104821.pdf\"\u003econclusions\u003c/a\u003e and took note of the proposed four indicators with one sub-indicator in the area ‘E — Women and Armed Conflict’.\u003c/p\u003e",
