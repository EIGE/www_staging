The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis indicator measures women’s representation in fields of political decision-making: the proportion of women in the single/lower houses of the national/federal parliaments of the EU Member States and in the European Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e",

The comparability over time and across countries is good. It is, however, necessary to bear in mind that the political and institutional systems are different from one country to another (some countries have a unicameral system while others have two chambers, electoral systems vary across Europe, etc.). In a unicameral system, the single chamber may undertake the functions which would be separated between upper and lower house in bicameral systems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eData are collected quarterly and published on the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-decision-making/database/index_en.htm\"\u003eEuropean Commission Database: women \u0026amp; men in decision-making website\u003c/a\u003e.
