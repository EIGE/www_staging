Training and accompaniment of all personnel involved, at all levels of responsibility, in the planning of strategies or in their operational implementation on the ground, remains to be developed. This approach is very important in the context of peacekeeping operations. One way of raising awareness among peacekeeping personnel is to include clauses on sexual violence in the mandates of these peacekeeping operations (PKO).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe implementation of indicators to evaluate and monitor training and accompaniment initiatives may give rise to a useful listing of trainers and experts in gender-based approaches and armed conflict, both at a European level and in the third countries concerned. Targets of the indicator include ministries and public administrations responsible for the area of women and armed conflict, and peacekeeping operations (PKO), at national and European levels, in charge of administrations and external missions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAccording to the French Presidency report, the data sources should be statistics and training reports of human resources departments of the services concerned; strategic guideline documents about gender and development; peacekeeping operations mission letters; mission execution reports; annual reports by the ministries of cooperation, defence and other public bodies concerned.\u003c/p\u003e",
