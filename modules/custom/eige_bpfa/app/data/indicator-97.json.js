According to the BPfA, governments should seek to ensure that before policy decisions are taken, an analysis of their impact on women and men respectively is carried out. Governments should also evaluate the impact of employment and income policies to ensure that women are direct beneficiaries of development. Governments should promote a gender perspective in legislation and give all ministries the mandate to review policies and programmes from a gender perspective. Inter-ministerial coordination structures should be established. In addition to the objectives addressed to governments, the BPfA includes objectives addressed to national machineries, advising them on promoting gender-mainstreaming. These objectives, however, deal more or less with the same issues as those directed at governments.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eIndicator H3 is based on the second main objective of the BPfA critical area of institutional mechanisms and indicates government commitment and status of gender-mainstreaming in the Member States. \u0026nbsp;Based on the 2006 Finnish Presidency report, this sum indicator with a maximum value of 10 included five aspects: (1) status of the governmental commitment to gender mainstreaming in public administration, (2) existence of structures and methods for use in gender mainstreaming, (3), gender impact assessment in law drafting, (4) gender impact assessment in drafting policy programmes and (5) gender budgeting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAccording to the BPfA, implementing gender mainstreaming requires governmental commitment; structure of governmental bodies and officials responsible for gender mainstreaming; consultation with gender experts both within the government and within civil society; knowledge (training and awareness-raising) on how to implement gender mainstreaming; and the use of methods and tools. Therefore, EIGE’s report proposes to improve this indicator by taking into consideration other gender mainstreaming tools (e.g. monitoring and evaluation) and proposing a re-structuring of indicator 3 with 3 aspects:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e1:\u0026nbsp; Status of the government’s commitment to gender mainstreaming\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e2:\u0026nbsp; Structures for gender mainstreaming\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e3:\u0026nbsp; Commitment to and use of the methods and tools for gender mainstreaming\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe maximum value of improved indicator is 16.
