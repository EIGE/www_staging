Healthy Life Years (HLY) is a solid  indicator to monitor health as a productivity/economic factor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eHLY introduces the concept of quality of life into  life expectancy. It is used to distinguish between years of life free of  any activity limitation and years experienced with at least one  activity limitation. The emphasis is not exclusively on the length of  life, as is the case for life expectancy, but also on the quality of  life. HLY is a functional health status measurement increasingly used to  complement the conventional life expectancy measures. Chronic disease,  frailty, and disability tend to become more prevalent at older ages, so  that a population with a higher life expectancy may not be healthier.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eIndeed, a major question within an ageing population  is whether increases in life expectancy will be associated with a  greater or lesser proportion of the future population spending their  years living with disability. If HLY is increasing more rapidly than  life expectancy in a population, then not only people are living longer,  they are also living a greater portion of their lives free of  disability.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe two components of the calculation of the HLY in  the EU are the mortality tables and the self-perceived disability  assessed by health surveys. Life tables which give mortality data for  calculating life expectancy are fully available as a demographic  long-term series based on the standard procedures of causes of death  registration harmonised at EU level.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eTo provide an overview of the situation, the following two HLY indicators were used in the report by the Austrian Presidency:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ehealthy life years in absolute value at birth\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epercentage of life expectancy\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

The self-perceived disability is based on the EU-SILC survey,  where an ‘unhealthy’ condition is defined by the limitation in the  activities people usually do because of health problems at least for the  last six months and this assessment is based on the question: ‘For at  least the past six months, to what extent have you been limited because  of a health problem in activities people usually do? Would you say you  have been: strongly limited/limited/not limited at all?’.\u003c/p\u003e",

The data are updated annually.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe HLY indicator is calculated using the same method (\u003ca href\u003d\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/Annexes/hlth_hlye_esms_an1.pdf\"\u003eSullivan’s\u003c/a\u003e)  for all countries. However, the comparability of the data across  countries may be limited since the question on the existence of  disabilities can be interpreted differently between countries. Moreover,  breaks in series, caused by the change in the data source for  calculating the prevalence of disability in 2004, limits comparability.  From 1995 to 2001, the EU-ECHP (European Community Household Panel)  results were used and since 2004 the EU-SILC (Statistics on Income and  Living Conditions) results have been used. The way this question was  implemented by the Member States, however, hampers cross-country  comparisons for the data up to 2008. Therefore, before 2008, the results  should be used with caution and only the evolution in time for each  country should be considered.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe overall accuracy of HLY is considered good.  However, the fact that institutional households are not covered by the  EU-SILC raises a potential problem of representativeness especially  because these persons are particularly exposed to health problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
