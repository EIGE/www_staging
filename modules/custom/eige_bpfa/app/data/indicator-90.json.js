Macroeconomic decision-making centres are institutions responsible for conceiving and formulating ideas, determining strategies and implementing fiscal, monetary and income (economic) policies on behalf of the state or the institutions they represent. Macroeconomic decision-makers are those who occupy formal and institutional positions in decision-making bodies and are actively involved in the deliberation and determination of economic policies and are responsible for implementing them on behalf of the state or institutions they represent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eMacroeconomic decisions, along with political decisions, have broad societal implications and the equal representation of women in the relevant structures is a necessary prerequisite for the empowerment of women and for women’s interests to be taken fully into account. Furthermore, macroeconomic institutions influence overall economic development, monetary stability and employment growth. Female representation at this level can, therefore, be seen as crucial to democracy and key to the development of gender equality in the labour market and society as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe labour confederations have an impact on the macroeconomic policy formulation through the process of bargaining with government authorities. This indicator is designed to assess the proportion of women among presidents and vice-presidents of employer confederations. Employer confederations at EU level which engage in the European social dialogue should be covered in the calculation of this indicator. The head of the highest decision-making body should be identified as a president.\u003c/p\u003e",
