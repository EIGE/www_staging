The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis indicator measures women’s representation in fields of political decision-making: the proportion of women in the regional parliaments of the Member States. A region was defined as being one level below the federal or national level in a political administrative hierarchy and having its own elective parliament (regional or provincial parliament/assembly). Not all Member States have regional levels of this kind.\u003c/p\u003e",
