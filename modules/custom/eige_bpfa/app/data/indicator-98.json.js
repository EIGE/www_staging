This may be achieved by ensuring equal access to sexual and reproductive health, providing information on different aspects of sexuality, and through contemporary population policies. The sexual and reproductive health measures include protection against sexually transmitted infections, unwanted or unplanned pregnancies, infant and maternal mortality. Prevention, however, also has a much wider and subtler impact on the rights of the girl child. Informed, self-aware and empowered girls are more likely to confront sexual abusers and are more capable of recognising the dangers of sexual exploitation and crimes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe socio-economic degradation and poverty determinant is also seen in the status of poor girls with regard to their reproductive and sexual health. As poor girls or girls from poor families are less informed and have inferior access to health services and programmes, they more often become very young mothers. As a result, their families become even poorer and the unwanted, unplanned or very early pregnancies become an important element in the vicious circle of poverty. The problem is even more persistent because early pregnancy and motherhood is, in many cases, the cause for leaving school early.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe indicator assesses the sex and relationship education provided in school programmes, at primary and secondary levels, and identifies and analyses the key elements of such education. Adequate sex and relationship education plays an important role in the development of the girl child’s sexual and reproductive health, and gender roles and relations, and is thus a necessary prerequisite for gender equality.\u003c/p\u003e",

Firstly, it is essentially composed of a number of sub-indicators which should really be broken apart into separate indicators. Secondly, it recorded aspects which do not appear to be useful for the purpose of monitoring: for example, it is not really important to know how the subject of sex education is named or whether it is autonomous subject.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThere are a number of possible improvements which could be made to this indicator:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe definition needs to be simplified to focus on exactly what needs to be monitored;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe indicator should be broken down into relevant indicators (i.e. age from which sex education is official taught):\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003edata should be collected on a regular basis;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe indicator/sub-indicators should be calculated and disseminated on a regular basis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
