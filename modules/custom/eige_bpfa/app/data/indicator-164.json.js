This is the global indicator which is most often used to compare the pay of women and men and to calculate the pay gap between them. It provides a more representative indicator for a large number of women than is provided by a calculation based only on the monthly earnings of full-time workers. Part-time employees need to be taken into account because part-time work has become a major component, in some cases the dominant component, of female employment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF8b:\u003c/strong\u003e The data cover all EU Member States and the oldest data are available from 1983 (but not for all Member States).

Another way of looking at gender gaps in employment is to calculate them on a full-time-equivalent basis. Such a measure takes into account the gender distribution of part-time work which could be considered a key indicator of gender equality. In some ways, the availability of part-time work has facilitated the reconciliation of work and parenthood. However, in most countries, part-time work remains ‘women’s work’, reinforcing the traditional gender division of labour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe employment rate of women and men aged between 15 and 64 for the same reference year as gender pay gap indicators should be analysed in the context of this indicator. The employment rate is important, because a narrow gender pay gap may be explained by the fact that the female employment rate is low, and that those who are working are also those who have the personal characteristics (level of education, profession, etc.) associated with higher salaries. This effect, known as the ‘selection effect’ may give the mistaken impression that there is great equality on the labour market. This is confirmed when female employment rates and pay gaps are compared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF8c:\u003c/strong\u003e The \u003ca href\u003d\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/en/earn_ses06_esms.htm\"\u003eStructure of earnings survey (SES)\u003c/a\u003e data covers all Member States and latest data are available for 2006.
