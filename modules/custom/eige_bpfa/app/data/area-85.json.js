The indicators are useful elaborations of both the first and the second objectives concerning the institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women that are put forward in the BPfA. The indicators cover both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the institutional mechanisms, which are necessary in order to evaluate to what extent the two objectives have been met.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe existing European databases did not include the necessary data for that survey and, therefore, a special survey to collect data was needed. The Finnish Presidency prepared a questionnaire and collected the data with the aid of all Member States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe aforementioned indicators were used in the third  EU-wide review of the BPfA conducted by the Swedish Presidency in 2009  and presented in the report \u003cstrong\u003e‘\u003ca href\u003d\"http://eige.europa.eu/content/document/beijing-15-platform-action-and-european-union-report-swedish-presidency-council-eur\"\u003eBeijing +15: The Platform for Action and the European Union\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e’. The  report concluded that although an increasing number of Member States had  both a minister responsible for gender equality issues and an  independent body for the promotion of equal treatment for women and men,  the mandates and responsibilities of these institutions varied to a  large extent between the Member States. It also emphasised the need to  enhance the status of these bodies in order to bring gender equality to  the forefront.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eBased on the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://eige.europa.eu/content/document/beijing-15-platform-action-and-european-union-report-swedish-presidency-council-eur\"\u003eSwedish Presidency report\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e,  the Council concluded that gender mainstreaming was not always  adequately implemented across policy domains, even though it had been  recognised in the Lisbon Strategy as being essential for economic  progress. Also, the 2009 Swedish Presidency report stated that in  several critical areas of concern statistical data are not always  available at the EU level and sometimes missing even at the national  level.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eBuilding on this background, in 2013 the  Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union chose to  review the indicators for area H on institutional mechanisms for gender  equality in the EU Member States at national/federal level.
