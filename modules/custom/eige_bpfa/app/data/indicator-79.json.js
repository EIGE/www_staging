  "concept": "\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe participation of women in the decision-making process is an important factor when discussing the position of women in a particular country and/or in the European Union. The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator measures women’s representation in fields of political decision-making: the proportion of women in the local assemblies of the Member States. This is the lowest administrative level where representatives are elected – generally municipalities.\u003c/p\u003e",

Data have been published in a number of different reports; hence, comparability over time may be difficult. Comparability between countries is good, but it is necessary to bear in mind that local political structures differ between countries or within a country (depending on the size of the municipality).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe data were added to the Commission database from 2012. In most countries, all municipalities or their equivalents are covered.

The main sources for collected data are national ministries (e.g. ministry of interior or similar); national statistical offices and direct contacts.
