Many single parents have to look after their children themselves and look for jobs with hours that enable them to spend as much time with their children as possible thus combining parenting with employment. As a result, they might be forced to settle for precarious, low paid employment with a lower level of social protection. The gap between the income of single parent families headed by women and men highlights once again the vulnerability to poverty of single parents, on the one hand, and of women on the other.\u003c/p\u003e",

Since 2005, the comparability of the data over time and across countries has been assessed as high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis poverty indicator is based on income inequality in the country and thus is a relative concept of poverty. Comparing relative poverty levels between different countries does not sufficiently take into account the differences in standards of living. For example, a person who is relatively poor in a rich country usually suffers less material deprivation than someone who is living in a country with low overall living standards. Furthermore, the data disaggregated by sex for single parents are not available.\u003c/p\u003e",
