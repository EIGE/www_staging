Comparing relative poverty levels between different countries does not sufficiently take into account the differences in standards of living. For example, a person who is relatively poor in a rich country usually suffers less material deprivation than someone who is living in a country with low overall living standards. Furthermore, the indicator does not directly measure women’s poverty because this measurement refers to individuals living in households and presupposes that resources are equally shared among household members.\u003c/p\u003e",
