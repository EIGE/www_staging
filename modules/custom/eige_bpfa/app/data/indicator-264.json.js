The Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) employment rate is a unit to measure employed persons in a way that makes them comparable although they may work a different number of hours per week. The unit is obtained by comparing an employee’s average number of hours worked to the average number of hours worked by a full-time worker. A full-time worker is therefore counted as one FTE, while a part-time worker gets a score in proportion to the hours she or he works. For example, a part-time worker employed for 20 hours a week where full-time work consists of 40 hours, is counted as 0.5 FTE.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne key target of the Europe 2020 Strategy is that 75 % of 20-64 years olds should participate in the labour force. Comparing the two employment indicators to this target is very pertinent from a gender equality perspective since men are less likely to be employed on part-time basis. The FTE employment rate is preferable to the standard headcount employment rate because it takes into consideration the heterogeneity of working hours among employed people, which is particularly relevant when addressing gender gaps in employment rates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe indicator is calculated by sex for the following age groups: 15-64, 20-64, 15-24, 25-54 and 55-64. The 20-64 age group is included in order to allow comparison with the Europe 2020 target.\u003c/p\u003e",
