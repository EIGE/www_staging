Women’s health involves their emotional, social and physical well-being and is determined by the social, political and economic context of their lives, as well as by biology.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eA major barrier for women to the achievement of the highest attainable standard of health is inequality, both between men and women and among women in different geographical regions, social classes and indigenous and ethnic groups. Women have different and unequal access to and use of basic health resources. Furthermore, women are subject to particular health risks due to inadequate responsiveness and lack of services to meet health needs related to sexuality and reproduction.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eWomen are affected by many of the same health conditions as men, but women experience them differently. The prevalence among women of poverty and economic dependence, their experience of violence, negative attitudes towards women and girls, racial and other forms of discrimination, the limited power many women have over their sexual and reproductive lives and lack of influence in decision-making are social realities which have an adverse impact on their health.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eSexual and gender-based violence, including physical and psychological abuse, trafficking in women and girls and other forms of abuse and sexual exploitation place girls and women at high risk of physical and mental trauma, disease and unwanted pregnancy. HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, the transmission of which is sometimes a consequence of sexual violence, are having a devastating effect on women’s health, particularly the health of adolescent girls and young women.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eWith the increase in life expectancy and the growing number of older women, their health concerns require particular attention.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eStatistical data on health are often not systematically collected, disaggregated and analysed by age, sex and socio-economic status and by established demographic criteria used to serve the interests and solve the problems of subgroups, with particular emphasis on the vulnerable and marginalised and other relevant variables. Relatively little is known about how social and economic factors affect the health of girls and women of all ages, about the provision of health services to girls and women and the patterns of their use of such services, and about the value of disease prevention and health promotion programmes for women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/sites/default/files/documents/Overview%20of%20BPfA%20-%20Women%20and%20Health%20-%20C.pdf\"\u003eOverview of the area C.
