The field of political decision-making is particularly important since politics is a very important aspect of the everyday life of every citizen — it affects all areas of our daily life. The importance of gender balance in positions of power is connected to the belief that decisions made by balanced gender groups are more likely to be sensitive to the needs of both sexes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator measures women’s representation in fields of political decision-making, assessing the proportion of women in the two highest ranking positions of national ministries and European Union Institutions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAt the national level, the following organisations and levels are included: ministries or government departments with Level 1 administrators: the highest level of administrative (non-political) positions within each ministry and Level 2 administrators: the second level of administrative (non-political) positions within each ministry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the European Union Institutions level, the following organisations and levels are included: Directorates-General and services of the European Commission; services of the European Parliament and General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union, Level 1 administrators: Director-General, Deputy Director-General or equivalent and Level 2 administrators: Director, Principal Advisor or equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e",
