The leave shall be granted for at least a period of four months and, to promote equal opportunities and equal treatment between men and women, should, in principle, be provided on a non-transferable basis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMen should be encouraged to assume an equal share of family responsibilities, for example to take parental leave, helping to close the gender gap and promoting women’s participation in the labour force. The right to parental leave (which is different to maternity leave for mothers and paternity leave for fathers) has been established in all Member States. However, large differences continue to exist between countries with regard to the legal framework, including duration, payment, proportion of leave that can be transferred between parents, and the part reserved for fathers only. Parental leave is still more prevalent among women than among men.\u003c/p\u003e",

  "notes": "\u003cp\u003eCalculations are based on LFS ad-hoc module (i.e. a special set of questions) 2010: Reconciliation between work and family life, where the parental leave is defined as a parental leave to care for their youngest child aged less than eight. Whereas the data are published by Eurostat at a more detailed level disaggregated by duration of parental leave, data for all groups in all countries are not available due to limitations of the sample. Therefore, in summary data presented some data on the parental leave could be missing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso in 2005, the EU-LFS included an ad hoc module on the ‘\u003ca href\u003d\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2004/l_005/l_00520040109en00570060.pdf\"\u003eReconciliation between work and family life\u003c/a\u003e’, which asked whether parental leave had been taken over the last 12 months to care for the respondent’s own children living in the household. It also gave an indication of whether the leave was remunerated or not for those who took leave, and under which kind of arrangement it was taken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, there are no available regular data for the calculation of this indicator at EU level. However, the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/lfsa_esms.htm\"\u003eLabour Force Survey (EU-LFS)\u003c/a\u003e collects information on employed persons on parental leave also in the core survey (i.e. the stable set of questions).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the core EU-LFS, there is one question to identify persons employed but absent from their jobs, and a second question asking for the main reason for absence. One of the possibility answers is ‘parental leave’. This allows an indirect identification and measure of people on parental leave and quarterly or annual estimates are possible. However, the indirect estimates based on the core EU LFS questions have three issues. Firstly, survey respondents are not asked directly if they are on parental leave: they can only be identified indirectly, and only in the case that they did not work at all (parents on part-time parental leave will not be identified). Secondly, the variable on the reason for being absent only identifies the main reason. Thirdly, no internationally harmonised definition of ‘parental leave’ is used in this variable; LFS relies on the spontaneous response of respondents as being on ‘parental leave’, which may be connected to the respondent being on an (national specific) administrative scheme of parental leave. The estimates based on the EU-LFS ad hoc module have higher reliability but only multiannual periodicity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn its \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,3746,en_2649_34819_37836996_1_1_1_1,00.html\"\u003eFamily database\u003c/a\u003e, the OECD uses a similar indicator (\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/57/41927348.pdf\"\u003eUse of childbirth-related leave by mothers and fathers\u003c/a\u003e) measuring the proportion of employed women and men with a child under one-year-old on maternity or parental leave.
