Furthermore, the CVD is the main cause of death for women.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe incidence of coronary heart disease in women increases dramatically in middle age, which has led to the speculation that menopause marks the end of a protective effect of ovarian hormones on cardiovascular disease. CHD results in many premature deaths and since clinical care in CVDs is costly and prolonged, it is also a major economic burden in Europe.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eFactors that have been identified as contributors to coronary heart disease for women include cholesterol, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity, hormonal changes and diabetes mellitus. To these classical risk factors we can add others if we incorporate the gender perspective to analyse the risk factors, such as socio-economic condition, links with health services, subjective construction of the illness, insertion to the labour market or interconnection among the different areas of work, personal interests and family life.\u003c/p\u003e",

The data are updated annually.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eInaccuracies may be due to errors with the issue of the death certificate, errors in the medical diagnosis, in the selection of the main cause of death or in the coding of the cause of death. Sometimes there is ambiguity in the cause of death. Indeed, there is criticism that the coding of only one illness as a cause of death appears more and more unrealistic. For the majority of the deceased of 65 years and older, the selection of just one cause of death may be somewhat misleading as they often have had several chronic diseases that concurrently led to death. For this reason, some Member States have started to consider multiple-cause coding.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAlthough definitions are harmonised, the statistics may not be fully comparable as classifications may vary when the cause of death is multiple or difficult to evaluate and because of different notification procedures. The coverage of residents dying abroad can also affect the comparability among countries (national practices concerning the registration of residents dying abroad and domestic deaths of non-residents are far from harmonised across Member States).\u003c/p\u003e",
