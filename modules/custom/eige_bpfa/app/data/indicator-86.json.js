Macroeconomic decision-making centres are institutions responsible for conceiving and formulating ideas, determining strategies and implementing fiscal, monetary and income (economic) policies on behalf of the state or the institutions they represent. Macroeconomic decision-makers are those who occupy formal and institutional positions in decision-making bodies and are actively involved in the deliberation and determination of economic policies and are responsible for implementing them on behalf of the state or institutions they represent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eMacroeconomic decisions, along with political decisions, have broad societal implications and the equal representation of women in the relevant structures is a necessary prerequisite for the empowerment of women and for women’s interests to be taken fully into account. Furthermore, macroeconomic institutions influence overall economic development, monetary stability and employment growth. Female representation at this level can, therefore, be seen as crucial to democracy and key to the development of gender equality in the labour market and society as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis indicator assesses the proportion of women among the members of the decision-making bodies of the central banks. A central bank is the entity responsible for overseeing the monetary system for a country (or group of Member States). Central banks oversee monetary policy, and work towards specific goals such as currency stability, low inflation and full employment. Central banks also generally issue currency, function as the bank of the government, regulate the credit system, oversee commercial banks, manage exchange reserves and act as a lender of last resort.\u003c/p\u003e",
