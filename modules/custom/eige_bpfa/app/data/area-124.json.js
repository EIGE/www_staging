Sectors such as energy, transport, and technological development are highly important for environmental issues but tend to be dominated by men in the workforce. Furthermore, managerial and policymaking positions in these sectors are entrusted mainly to men. Women remain absent from leadership, political and entrepreneurial decision-making, from ownership in various companies, from the workforce in this sector and from the technical schools and scientific educational institutions where the future labour force is trained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addressing the lack of adequate recognition and support for women’s contribution to conservation and management of natural resources and safeguarding the environment, governments and other actors should promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies and programmes, including, as appropriate, an analysis of the effects on women and men, respectively, before decisions are taken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/sites/default/files/documents/Overview%20of%20BPfA%20-%20Women%20and%20the%20Environment%20-%20K.pdf\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverview of area K.

Many other areas are also of very high relevance for climate change policies. Although these indicators largely focus on the issue of climate change mitigation, they also to some extent cover areas such as climate change adaptation policy, as well as broader environmental issues, which are not the main focus of these conclusions.
