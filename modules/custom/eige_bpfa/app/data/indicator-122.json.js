The fact that processes linked to armed conflicts, peace negotiations, security operations, etc., are directed and implemented mainly by men, may affect the insufficient account taken as women’s roles as active participants in peace and democracy, and the discriminations, inequalities and violence of which they are victims. Equal involvement of women and men in these processes forms the basis of possible progress.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eIn general, this equal participation at similar levels of responsibility should concern the personnel of diplomatic services; early warning systems; armies and peacekeeping forces; peace negotiations; disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes (DDR) and security system reform (SSR) processes; police; justice; transitional governments, electoral processes; development of public post-crisis policies; management of refugee camps; the welcoming of refugees and asylum seekers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTargets of the indicator include ministries and administrations involved in diplomacy, peacekeeping operations (PKO), defence and police missions. According to the French Presidency report, the data sources should be documents and statistics of the human resources departments of the administrations concerned and institutional organisational charts.\u003c/p\u003e",
