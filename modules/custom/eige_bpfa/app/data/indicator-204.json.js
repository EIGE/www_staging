One of the factors that best explains the gender pay gap is segregation in the labour market. Women are often over-represented in sectors, occupations and positions where pay tends to be moderate. There are two types of segregation. Firstly, horizontal segregation, which relates to the high concentration of women in certain occupations and certain sectors and which is gender based. Secondly, vertical segregation which refers to the high concentration of women in lower ranking positions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eDespite equal qualifications, women do not have the same career opportunities and less often hold management posts. In the literature, vertical segregation is represented by the image of a ‘glass ceiling’ (i.e. the full range of visible or invisible barriers that explain why so few women hold high-level positions). Women are often excluded from the more prestigious occupations that involve greater responsibility and higher pay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe mirror image of the ‘glass ceiling’ is the ‘sticky floor’, representing the barriers that could prevent women from moving up the ladder. That concept describes the forces that tend to keep women at the bottom of the organisational pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator includes following three sub-indicators:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e F12a: Average gross hourly wages of female and male workers in the 5 industry sectors (NACE, 2 digits) with the highest numbers of female workers and the highest numbers of male workers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF12b: Average gross hourly wages of female and male workers in the 5 professional categories (ISCO categories, 2 digits) with the highest numbers of female workers and the highest numbers of male workers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF12c: Pay gap in management (ISCO 12 and 13)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",

The idea is that women are hampered by ‘invisible’ obstacles which prevent them from reaching the highest levels of responsibility and this phenomenon is observed at different stages of their careers.

As Group 11 includes public sector officials, that group is not given for all countries and it is not included in the calculation either. Consequently, the gender pay gap is calculated for the ISCO 12 and ISCO 13 occupations.\u003c/p\u003e",
