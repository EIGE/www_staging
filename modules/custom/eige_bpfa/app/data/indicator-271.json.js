It is calculated by dividing the number of part-time workers by the total number of employed persons. Employed persons are individuals aged 15 and over who perform work, even for just one hour per week, for pay, profit or family gain during the reference week or are not at work but have a job or business from which they are temporarily absent because of, for instance, illness, holidays, industrial dispute, and education or training (Eurostat, LFS). The distinction between full-time and part-time work is made on the basis of a spontaneous answer given by the respondent. Establishing a more exact distinction between part-time and full-time work on the basis of working hours is impossible, due to differences across Member States and by branches of industry (as well as in the private vs the public sector) in the number of hours, used to define a part-time job by law or in collective agreements. The indicator is calculated by sex for the following age groups: 15-64, 20-64, 15-24, 25-54 and 55-64. It is an important indicator as it captures one of the main differences in labour force participation between women and men.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndicator 19 on part-time employment is complemented with six sub-indicators which need to be monitored in addressing gender differences in part-time work:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003egender differences among part-time workers;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egender differences in the reasons for working part-time;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esectoral and occupational differences between full-time and part-time work for women and men;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eusual weekly working hours in part-time jobs;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003elow pay share in part-time employment;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egender differences in transitions between part-time and full-time jobs\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSub-indicators\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19A. Share of women part‑time workers out of total part‑time workers by age groups (15-64, 20-64, 15-24, 25-54, 55-64)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator A measures the percentage of women out of total part-time employment. This new sub-indicator is useful to underline the predominance of women in part-time work. The distribution of part-time work between women and men is a useful measure from a gender equality perspective since it provides information on the norms attached to the roles of women and men and how these relate to their participation in the labour force. From a policy perspective, the objective related to this sub-indicator is simple: parity in part-time work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19B. Main reason for part‑time employment for women and men (15-64)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator B captures the main reasons that can lead to part-time work. In the Labour Force Survey, the main reason for part-time can be one the following:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eundergoing school education or training; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eown illness or disability; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003elooking after children or incapacitated adults; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eother family or personal reasons; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecould not find a full-time job; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eother reasons. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile the survey originally includes six main reasons, the sub-indicator focuses on the reasons most likely to lead to involuntary part-time work and most relevant from the perspective of gender equality. This includes ‘could not find a full-time job’ and ‘looking after children or incapacitated adults’ together with ‘other family or personal reasons’. The first category is already often used to capture involuntary part-time work. However, although caring activities can be understood as a choice as well as a constraint, in some circumstances they can also lead to involuntary part-time work. Parental responsibilities have a strong influence on the type of job sought, in particular because of social norms attributed to women. Part-time jobs are often chosen as a way to tackle difficulties in balancing work and family responsibilities. Furthermore, this reason may be indirectly related to involuntary part-time, particularly when childcare and other services for the household are lacking or are very expensive. In these cases, women are more likely than men to give up searching for a full-time job because of childcare and other family responsibilities attributed to them by societal norms.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSub-indicator B is calculated by dividing the number of total part-time workers in the age group 15-64 by the following main reasons:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003erespondents who report that they work part-time because they could not find a full-time job; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003erespondents who report that they work part-time to look after children or incapacitated adults and other family or personal responsibilities. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19C. Usual weekly working hours in part‑time jobs for women and men (15+)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator C measures the average weekly working hours in the main job on a part-time basis and persons working 10 hours or less. It covers all hours including extra hours, either paid or unpaid, which a person normally works. The distinction between full-time and part-time work is made on the basis of a spontaneous answer given by the respondent. This sub-indicator has the advantage of being simple and parsimonious. It captures gender differences in ‘micro’ job (up to 10 hours per week) that might affect economic independence. The sub-indicator is presented by sex and for the age group 15 and over.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19D. Low pay share in part‑time employment for women and men (15-64)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSub-indicator D presents the low pay threshold, based on the same criteria used by several other international institutions (e.g. ILO, OECD, Eurostat), namely hourly wages falling below two thirds of the median of the overall wage distribution. The indicator is calculated by sex by dividing the number of part-time workers who fall below the low pay threshold by total part-time in the population aged 15-64. The share of low paid employment is particularly relevant when addressing the overall effects of the gender pay gap also combined with gender segregation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19E. Sectoral and occupational differences between full‑time and part‑time employment for women and men (15-64)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator E measures sectoral and occupational differences between part-time and full-time employment for women and men. It has been calculated on the basis of the Duncan and Duncan Index of Dissimilarity (ID). This is calculated by taking the sum of the absolute differences, in each sectors (or occupations), between full-time and part-time employment. It can be interpreted as the percentage of employed workers that would need to change economic sector (or occupation) in order to obtain the same sectoral (or occupational) distribution between full-time and part-time employment. The Index of Dissimilarity (ID) is computed for sectoral and occupational differences between full-time and part-time employment for both women and men aged 15 to 64. The sub-indicator is particularly relevant to monitor the theoretical transition an employee would have to make between full-time and part-time work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19F.
