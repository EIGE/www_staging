  "concept": "\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis is a complementary indicator used as a possible instrument for further in-depth research on the gender pay gap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe indicator is descriptive in nature and shows how the pay gap varies depending on certain characteristics (age, education, sector, occupation, household composition, nationality, type of contract, etc.). The indicator examines the influence of each factor on the pay gap and, hence, the relationship between the pay gap and those variables. It breaks the pay gap down into various components by means of econometric techniques. Such a method gives an indication of how far the variation in salaries between women and men may be attributed to a number of known factors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe breakdown divides the pay gap into two components: an explainable component and an unexplainable component. The first component represents those pay gaps which are associated with the average differences between women and men in terms of the characteristics observed. It indicates the extent to which the pay gap can be accounted for by the various characteristics associated with the position of women and men in the labour market: for example, a strong presence of women in lower paid sectors or their shorter length of service in the labour market. All characteristics being equal (same length of service, same age, working in the same sector, same occupation and same level of education, etc.), women generally earn less than men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe second component of the pay gap corresponds to that part which does not result from identifiable differences in characteristics observed in the database used. On the one hand, this component comprises discrimination per se, that is the fact that identical characteristics are remunerated differently, generally to the detriment of women: women being paid less on average than men with the same level of education, a lower value being placed on length of service, slower age-related advancement, etc. On the other hand, it also covers the effect of unobserved variables or characteristics on pay gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe model used to break down the pay gap is the Oaxaca-Blinder base model (1973).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe pay gap will be decomposed into an initial component identifying the respective influence of each variable with respect to the total pay gap, the relative contribution to the total pay gap of: part-time working arrangements; the level of education; age; length of service in the enterprise; the sector; the occupation; the hierarchical position; the size of the enterprise; the type of contract; the type of economic and financial control of the enterprise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second component, the balance of the pay gap, takes account of discrimination and the effect of unobserved variables.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "notes": ": data are not available; the model used for decomposing the gender pay gap is the Oaxaca-Blinder base model (1973). The gender pay gap, calculated on average gross hourly earnings for men and women, is split into the explained gender pay gap (relative to the productivity components such as occupation, sector, type of contract, employment time, supervisory position, size of firm, level of education, age, years  of service in the company) and the unexplained gender pay gap (relative to the discrimination components, which are estimated as the residual left after adjusting the gender differential for differences in various characteristics). For example: in Cyprus the gender pay gap is 23.67%, but the productivity components are able to explain only a gender pay gap equal to 11.06%. Therefore, between the gender pay gap and the explained gender pay gap there is a difference of 12.61%, with this percentage hence representing the unexplained gender pay gap. The results are significant at a level of 1%.",
