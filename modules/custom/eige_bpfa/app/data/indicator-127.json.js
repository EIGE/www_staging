This phenomenon is due to the continuous increase in life expectancy among both men and women and to the recent low fertility rates registered in the majority of Member States. Both factors impact dramatically on the size of the European population size and the age structure, inevitably resulting in an increased old-age dependency ratio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the context of an ageing population, an indicator on caring for elderly persons is crucial. As women are generally in charge of taking care of their family (including old dependent persons), this indicator should also give an insight into their availability to participate in the labour market.\u003c/p\u003e",
