One of the major obstacles to the prevention and compensation of these crimes, and consequently human development as a whole, is the impunity with which they are committed, for reasons relating to the lack of capability of police and justice infrastructure in certain countries, and a generalised cultural and social perception that minimises the seriousness of crimes against women.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eA prevention strategy involves the reinforcement of actions to combat discrimination, as well as the increased promotion of women’s rights in support programmes in third countries in general, and particularly in sensitive areas, drafting and reform of constitutions, political, legal and administrative reforms. Moreover, with women and their organisations playing a major (mainly local) role in various areas of the fight against violence, reproductive health, access to rights and to peace, it seems important to measure if they enjoy significant support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe implementation of this indicator might permit a more global view of all European actions in the area of cooperation and rights, and their scope. It might also lead to enumerating, improving knowledge of and reinforcing local organisations run by women.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eTargets of indicators are the action programmes of the Member States and the EU in regions affected by armed conflict, in the area of the fight against discrimination and violence, access to treatment, and the fight against impunity and protection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the French Presidency report, the data sources should be technical and budgetary analyses of documents of the programmes and projects of Member States and reports of these programmes in these areas and the analysis of sector-based policy documents of partner states in these areas. However, the value of the indicator was not calculated in that report and the direct source for the calculation of the indicator was not mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e",
