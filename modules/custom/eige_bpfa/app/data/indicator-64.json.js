  "concept": "\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe relative distribution of women and men at the different levels of seniority in academia is crucial to the promotion of gender parity. Therefore, it is vital that the vertical dimension of employment in academia is realigned from a gender-biased research arena towards a creative and sustainable R\u0026amp;D environment benefiting from equal contributions by women and men.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe indicator on the proportion of female and male academic staff of total academic staff by grade and in total allows gender ratios to be assessed at different levels of seniority. Academic staff grades serve as points of reference. Proposed by the European Commission, this classification was developed by the Statistical Correspondents (subgroup of the Helsinki Group on Women and Science) in order to account for the vertical dimension of academia, which is not encompassed in the ISCED classification. The academic staff grades portray the link between position in academic institutions, experience and level of educational attainment:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGrade A: the single highest grade/post at which research is normally conducted; \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGrade B: researchers working in positions not as senior as top position (A) but more senior than newly qualified PhD holders;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGrade C: the first grade/post into which a newly qualified PhD (ISCED6) graduate would normally be recruited.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
