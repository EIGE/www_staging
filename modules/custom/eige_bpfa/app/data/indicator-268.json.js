Self-employed persons are those who work in their own business, farm or professional practice. A self-employed person is considered to be working if she/he meets one of the following criteria: works for the purpose of earning profit, spends time on the operation of a business or is in the process of setting up her/his business. The indicator is calculated by sex for the following age groups: 15-64, 20-64, 15-24, 25-54 and 55-64.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndicator 20 on self-employment is complemented by three sub-indicators measuring relevant features of self-employment that have to be monitored from a gender equality perspective:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eself-employment with and without employees;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eincome from self-employment;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ework-life balance in self-employment;\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSub-indicators\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA. Share of self‑employed women and men with and without employees (15-64)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator A is calculated as the percentage of self-employed persons with employees (employers) and without employees (own-account workers) from total employment. Self-employed persons are the ones who work in their own business, farm or professional practice. A self-employed person is considered to be working if she/he meets one of the following criteria: works for the purpose of earning profit, spends time on the operation of a business or is in the process of setting up her/his business. Self-employment embraces a wide range of work statuses and activities with different degrees of economic conditions and independence. Thus, it is important to distinguish among the self-employed with employees (employers) from those who work on their own (own-account workers). The share of self-employed with employees may be considered a better proxy for entrepreneurship than the share of overall self-employed in total employment although it remains unclear whether it adequately measures the concept. Moreover, the share of self-employed without employees can also incorporate a number of ‘bogus’ self-employed persons. This is characterised by a number of factors, including: dependency of one main client; presence of regular payments; lack of capacity to hire new workers and/or to make important decisions related to the business. The sub-indicator is calculated by sex and for 15-64 age group.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eB. Median income in Euros from self‑employment for women and men (15+)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator B is defined as the annual income received, in the reference period, as a result of current or former involvement in self-employment. To calculate the indicator the negative values (losses) were excluded from the calculations and considered income before taxes. Income from self-employment is of particular relevance to monitor the gender gap in earnings and compare it with earnings in employment. Given the considerable variance over-time and across individuals, and to reduce the impact of outliers, the median (instead of the mean) is reported. The indicator is calculated in Euros, by sex and for those aged 15+.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eC. Fit of working hours with family or social commitments for self‑employed women and men (15+)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSub-indicator C shows differences by sex in workers’ perceptions of how working time fits with family and social needs for self-employed workers. The exact wording of the question out of which the indicator is constructed is: ‘In general, do your working hours fit in with your family or social commitments outside work very well, well, not very well or not at all well?’ with 4 possible answers: 1. Very well, 2. Well, 3. Not very well, 4. Not at all well. The indicator is defined as the percentage of women and men reporting that their working hours fit well or very well with family or social commitments (values 1 and 2 set equal to 1). It can be used as a proxy to measure work-life balance, which is one of the main reasons given by women to explain why they are working as self-employed. Hence it is relevant to evaluate and monitor whether the work schedule of individuals (and women in particular) actually fits with family and other commitments outside work. The indicator is calculated by sex and for those aged 15+.\u003c/p\u003e",
