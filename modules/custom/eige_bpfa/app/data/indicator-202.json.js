It is important to analyse the impact of part-time work because this factor together with education-level differences and labour market segregation will be largely responsible for the gender pay gap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003ePart-time work frequently entails differences in hourly earnings too because this type of work often carries a wage penalty and is generally performed more by women than men. It is important to take this account when analysing pay gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eGross hourly earnings are calculated for women working full and part-time and men working full and part-time, so as to be able to make a comparison of the earnings of these different categories by combining the respective figures. Four different pay gaps can be observed: those between women and men working part-time, between women working part-time and men working full-time, between men working part-time and men working full-time, and, lastly, between women working part-time and men working full-time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator includes following two sub-indicators:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eF10a: Gross hourly wages and pay gap: female (part-time) - male (part-time); female (part-time) - female (full-time); male (part-time) - male (full-time); female (part-time) - male (full-time)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eF10b: Part-time employment rate by sex\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",

Some indicators were not calculated for all the Member States. In principle, the figures relate to the Member States; many of the indicators, however, could not be calculated for Denmark, Malta or Austria as microdata about those countries were not available to researchers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"TAVALINE\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF10b:\u003c/strong\u003e The data cover all EU Member States and the oldest data are available from 1983 (but not for all Member States).
