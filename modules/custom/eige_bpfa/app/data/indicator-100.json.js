Gender roles are reinforced by traditional beliefs and practices in schooling, studying and making job and career choices. The persistent prejudice of sex-differentiated talents and capabilities are already reflected at a very early age and could seriously influence the life choices of many girls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe indicator addresses the discrepancy between the aptitude of girls in mathematics and science literacy (which does not significantly differ from that of boys) compared with their subsequent choice of further educational field at tertiary level (ISCED 5—6), where boys and girls continue to follow traditional educational paths. The indicator helps to assess the potential impact of policies and measures to encourage both girls and boys to explore non-traditional educational paths and, thus, to use their talents and potential to the full, thereby also contributing to the achievement of the goals of the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.\u003c/p\u003e",
