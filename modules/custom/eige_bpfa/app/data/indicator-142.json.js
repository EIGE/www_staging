It must be emphasised that this definition does not cover all forms of gender-based violence.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThis indicator describes the existing range of support for women subject to domestic violence and is both qualitative and quantitative. Qualitatively, the indicator will describe the full range of support options and, quantitatively, the number of options and the actual use of these options. For example, if the existence of crisis centres is confirmed, the number and the use of these should be mentioned. Furthermore, there should be room for a qualitative description of the quality of the support that these crisis centres are offering. For some of these support options, it will be possible to clarify the extent to which they are used.
