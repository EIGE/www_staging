A government commitment to promoting gender equality can, therefore, be measured in terms of resource allocation to the governmental gender equality body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe indicator indicates the ratio of personnel resources available to the governmental gender equality body compared to the size of the Member State in terms of population. It thereby represents a government commitment to promoting gender equality in terms of resource allocation to the governmental gender equality body. The number of employees is given in person-years meaning full-time, all-year employment excluding all project personnel that do not receive funding from the state budget. The indicator is calculated from the ratio of employees per population (million) in each EU Member State and it describes the deviation from the median.\u003c/p\u003e",

As the numbers of the personnel are changing more or less all the time, many Member States updated the data in September 2006. This may cause minor unreliability in the exact figures given in this report, but does not substantially affect the results.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe functions and mandates of a governmental gender equality body require a certain minimum of employees regardless of the population. This means that even the smallest states need to employ a certain minimum, which tends to result in top scores for the smaller Member States. The indicator does not take account of the size of the Member State’s government budget as a whole since that would have made the indicator much more complex.\u003c/p\u003e",
