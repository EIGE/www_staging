The division according to the age group of the children is essential because care needs vary with age. Going to (pre)school is not considered as a form of care but rather as education (and, in this respect, should be largely accessible to all children), which explains why the indicator is limited to care facilities provided before and after (pre)school hours for children of school age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also has to be stressed that the use of childcare facilities does not directly answer the question of whether demand is fully met. Moreover, a relatively low share of children cared for formally may not necessarily indicate shortages, as extended parental leave facilities are available in some countries.\u003c/p\u003e",
