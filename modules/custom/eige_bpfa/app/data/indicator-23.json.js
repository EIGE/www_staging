Employment is perceived by many Member States as a key factor for social inclusion and offers the most important means of escaping the poverty cycle. Being employed and earning wages is crucial for the economic independence of women and men; therefore, those events that may lead women and men of working age to interrupt their working lives or not to participate in the labour market can generate a risk of potential poverty.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eFor analysis of the situation, the age group 16–64 was used in the report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInactivity has been defined as the percentage of persons, who are classified neither as employed nor as unemployed in the labour market. Employed persons are all persons who worked at least one hour for pay or profit during the reference week or were temporarily absent from such work. Unemployed persons are all persons who were not employed during the reference week and had actively sought work during the past four weeks and were ready to begin working immediately within two weeks. Inactivity does not, however, mean that persons who are in this category are inactive in general. They can, for example, be taking care of children or incapacitated adults, doing domestic work or studying.\u003c/p\u003e",
