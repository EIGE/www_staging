Personal circumstances such as family composition, marital status or country of birth play a key role in women and men’s earnings and may partially explain the gender pay gap. Family composition and marital status generally affect the earnings of women and men in opposing ways and can, therefore, exacerbate the gender pay gap. The earnings of women who have children and/or are married are generally lower than those of women who have no children and/or are unmarried, and lower than the earnings of men. Conversely, men who have children and/or are married on average earn more than men who have no children and/or are unmarried, and more than women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThat phenomenon may, inter alia, be explained by discrimination and gender stereotypes that assign certain tasks to women and others to men according to a gender-based division of labour whether it is unpaid work undertaken in a private capacity or remunerated work in the labour market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eThe same is true for the country of birth, which can negatively impact on pay and together with gender have a cumulative effect in the case of women.

The data were updated annually until 2000: since then, the data have been updated quarterly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be pointed out, that comparisons of headcount measures of employment by gender overestimate women’s employment and underestimate the gender employment gap in all countries, as they take no account of the higher incidence of part-time employment and absence from work of women. Another way of looking at gender gaps in employment is to calculate them on a full-time equivalent basis. Such a measure takes into account the gender distribution of part-time work which could be considered a key indicator of gender equality. In some ways, the availability of part-time work has facilitated the reconciliation of work and parenthood. However, in most countries, part-time work remains ‘women’s work’, reinforcing the traditional gender division of labour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF13b:\u003c/strong\u003e The data cover all EU Member States and the oldest data are available from 1995 (but not for all Member States).
