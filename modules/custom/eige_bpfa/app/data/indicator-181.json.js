In a few cases, positions were vacant and were therefore not calculated in the final figures.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp class\u003d\"Tavaline\"\u003eAccording to the available data by sectors, in 10 Member States (BE, EE, EL, FR, LU, HU, MT, NL, PT and SE) some ministries or institutions work in several sectors. Therefore, when the information on the relevant individuals was collected, the individual was included under all relevant sectors. When calculating the numbers by levels or total (all three sectors together), these individuals were taken into account once only. Summarising numbers by sectors and by levels or total can, therefore, give different results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe baseline data are presented in more detail in the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Gender-Equality-and-Climate-Change-Report.pdf\"\u003eEIGE report \"Women and the Environment: Gender Equality and Climate Change\"\u003c/a\u003e in Chapter 4 and Annex II. The indicator is objectively verifiable and can be updated using the methodology developed for obtaining the baseline data, as discussed in the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Gender-Equality-and-Climate-Change-Report.pdf\"\u003eEIGE report \"Women and the Environment: Gender Equality and Climate Change\"\u003c/a\u003e in Annex I.
